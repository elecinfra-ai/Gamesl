# Central Snake ‚Äî Friends-ish PWA

A cozy, coffeehouse-themed Snake game with obstacles, power-ups, and speed boosts. Built with vanilla JS and packaged as a Progressive Web App.

## Features
- Obstacles (sofa blocks) that increase over time.
- Power-ups:
  - **Pivot!**: temporary wall pass-through (wrap).
  - **Smelly Cat**: slows time.
  - **Sarcasm**: doubles points.
- **Speed Boost** item that temporarily accelerates the snake.
- Swipe controls for mobile, keyboard for desktop.
- Offline support via Service Worker; installable via manifest.

## Run locally

   - Node: `npx serve`
3. Open http://localhost:8080 and play. Use the *Install* button to add it as an app.
